# DeepTime-Fdx-Dynamics
Algorithms and scripts from "Elucidating Deep-Time Ferredoxin Modules within Macromolecules Using Dynamical Attributes," focusing on isolating [4Fe-4S] binding bacterial ferredoxins within macromolecular assemblies through sequence, structure, and dynamical attributes via normal mode analysis (NMA).
